## Overview

### Description

An app to allow trading between trading card game players and collectors. 

### App Evaluation

- TCG Trader - API available (OPTCG API)
- Category: Trading/Collectibles

Why it's good for Mobile:
- Instant access to your trading lists and matches on the go.
- Push notifications for new matching trades in your area.
- Location-based matching ensures convenience for local meetups or     
    transactions.

Story:
- TCG Trader revolutionizes trading for trading card enthusiasts by providing
    a seamless way to connect with others who have what you need and want what   
    you have.
- Helps collectors who don't necessarily want to sell cards, but are more 
    interested in trading.
- Creates a more engaging trading experience by fostering local connections 
    and communities.

Market:
- Specifically targets trading card game (TCG) collectors, including those 
    involved in games like Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and in our 
    base case, the one piece trading card game.
- Provides a much-needed digital tool for a niche group that typically relies 
    on manual tracking or in-person meetups.
- Appeals to casual and hardcore collectors alike.

Habit:
- Encourages regular use as users log new cards they acquire or wish to 
    trade.
- Users will frequently check for matches, particularly after events, 
    purchases, or booster pack openings.
- Over time, the app becomes the go-to platform for managing TCG trades and 
    inventory.

Scope:
- The initial app includes essential features: creating and managing two card 
    lists (trade away and want), location-based trade pairing, and notifications 
    for matches.
- Future iterations could include advanced features like trade value 
    calculators, a rating system for trusted traders, and integration with more 
    APIs for deeper collection insights.
- The project is easily defined.
