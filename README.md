## Overview

### Description

An app to allow trading between trading card game players and collectors. 

### App Evaluation

- TCG Trader - API available (OPTCG API)
- Category: Trading/Collectibles

Why it's good for Mobile:
- Instant access to your trade lists 
- Future implementation of searching for trades based on location

Story:
- An app that helps you categorize TCG cards to set up trades
- Helps collectors who don't necessarily want to sell cards, but are more 
    interested in trading.

Market:
- Specifically targets trading card game (TCG) collectors, including those 
    involved in games like Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and in our 
    base case, the One Piece Trading card game.
- Provides a much-needed digital tool for a niche group that typically relies 
    on manual tracking or in-person meetups.
- Appeals to casual and hardcore collectors alike.

Habit:
- Encourages regular use as users log new cards they acquire or wish to 
    trade.
- Over time, the app becomes the go-to platform for managing TCG trades and 
    inventory.
- Future funtionality will have users frequently check for matches, particularly after events, 
    purchases, or booster pack openings.

Scope:
- The initial app includes essential features: creating and managing two card 
    lists (trade away and want), Account creation and management
- Future iterations Will allow players to be matched to trade based on location
- The project is easily defined.
