# Top 3 Brainstorming Ideas
## Glucose Tracker - An app to track blood Sugar API available (Dexcom)
Category: Medical

### Why it's good for Mobile:
- Notifications to log Glucose
- The need to log anywhere
- Possible wearable integration, Glucometers and Pumps

### Story:
- Helps collect data for insulin dependant diabetics.
- Allows a more engaging experience for insulin dependant diabetics. 
- Current glcometers are passive and require checks.
    
### Market: 
- This app is dedicated to insulin dependant diabetics, both type one and type two diabetes. 
- This app would provide a more engaging option for tracking blood sugar, it provides a niche group of people a nice tool to use. 
- The app has a very well defined user base. 
    
### Habit: 
- This app is not habit-forming. 
- Ideally the user would open the app for every meal. 
- The user creates lists and stores data. 
    
### Scope: 
- The scope could grow dramatically but the initial app is well defined. 
- The app will be technically simple to create based on what we have used so far.
    - The stripped down version of the app would be the baseline for the project. 
- The project is easily defined. 
    

## Diabetic Notebook - API avalable (Dexcom)
Category: Medical

### Why it's good for Mobile:
- Quick access to notes and reminders about meals, medications, and blood sugar levels.
- Notifications for tracking meal times, medication schedules, or doctor appointments.
- Integration with mobile features like voice notes, photo uploads (e.g.,food logs), and cloud storage.

### Story:
- Designed as a personalized assistant for diabetics to organize all diabetes-related information in one place.
- Moves beyond simple tracking to provide a customizable and user-friendly platform for meal planning, medication adherence, and recording insights.
- Helps users gain better control of their diabetes management by acting as an always-available resource for reference and planning.

### Market:
- Targets diabetics of all types who seek better organization in their daily routines, beyond just blood sugar monitoring.
- Appeals to those managing diabetes with a holistic approach, combining diet, medication, exercise, and regular health updates.
- Serves a wide demographic while being particularly helpful for newly diagnosed patients who need structured guidance.

### Habit:
- Encourages regular use by providing easy logging, reminders, and customizable features.
- Users are prompted to engage at key moments, such as before meals, after exercise, or during medication times.
- Over time, the app could help users build healthy routines through structured organization.

### Scope:
- The initial app includes simple features like note-taking, reminders, and basic data visualization for logs (e.g., daily/weekly meal summaries or medication adherence).
- Long-term growth could include integrations with other tools (glucometers, fitness trackers), analytics for trends, or AI-driven suggestions for meal planning or lifestyle adjustments.
- The project is easily defined. 

## TCG Trader - API available (OPTCG API)
Category: Trading/Collectables

### Why it's good for Mobile:
- Instant access to your trade lists 
- Future implementation of searching for trades based on location

### Story:
- An app that helps you categorize TCG cards to set up trades
- Helps collectors who don't necessarily want to sell cards, but are more 
    interested in trading.

### Market:
- Specifically targets trading card game (TCG) collectors, including those involved in games like Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and in our base case, the One Piece Trading card game.
- Provides a much-needed digital tool for a niche group that typically relies on manual tracking or in-person meetups.
- Appeals to casual and hardcore collectors alike.

### Habit:
- Encourages regular use as users log new cards they acquire or wish to trade.
- Over time, the app becomes the go-to platform for managing TCG trades and inventory.
- Future funtionality will have users frequently check for matches, particularly after events, purchases, or booster pack openings.

### Scope:
- The initial app includes essential features: creating and managing two card lists (trade away and want), Account creation and management
- Future iterations Will allow players to be matched to trade based on location
- The project is easily defined.
